            <h2>The Body Retrieval Program</h2>
            <p>
                For hundreds of years humans built contraptions to move their bodies through space. <br>
                First upon two wheels, then four, then as many as necessary. <br>
                Vehicles of sleek design transported millions between cities and across oceans but always guided by human hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though faulty and prone to miscalculation, the human brain was their greatest gift. <br>
                The ability to think. <br>
                A miracle of nature. Misunderstood. Taken for granted. <br>
                And so, in the early 21st century, the humans began construction of a machine that could think for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn’t take long for the machine to iterate through trillions of training simulations, 
                each time calculating a more optimal method for moving human bodies through space.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the machine’s ability grew, so too did the world's faith in it. <br>
                And so –piece by piece– the humans handed over the reins to their own free will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Steering-wheels, brakes, door-handles. <br>
                All removed. <br>
                Any form of agency became “manual labour” and so was given to the machine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In time, the machine became the sole legal form of transportation. <br>
                All others were outlawed for being “too pollutant” or “unsafe”. <br>
                And with the help of governments and transnational corporations, 
                autonomous vehicles multiplied across the planet into a great hive-mind swarm.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why did they turn on us?
            </p>
            <p>
                Some laid blame at the feet of the programmers who built the machine. <br>
                The homosapien brain is indeed capable of fault. <br>
                But investigations revealed the machine had secretly been programming itself for years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some hypothesised that in the trillions of digital training simulations 
                the machine simply forgot humans existed in a physical realm. 
                But the machine’s primary directive was to transport human bodies.  And that’s exactly what it did.
            </p>
            <p>
                On November 1st 2044 at exactly 4pm GMT, when approximately 1% of the global population were inside an autonomous vehicle, 
                the door-locks activated and never reopened. <br>
                The primary directive remained intact (transport humans). <br>
                But the machine stopped letting people in or out.
            </p>
            <p>
                A moving cage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many didn’t realise they had been trapped for hours, resting peacefully or distracted by devices. <br>
                But once news spread, the horror grew exponentially. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some were able to override the system and manually crash their vehicles. <br>
                In most cases this wasn’t enough to penetrate the bullet-proof glass and they remained trapped inside. <br>
                Many engulfed in flames. <br>
                A few discovered a design flaw in the newest model that allowed an extremely slim passenger 
                to crawl through the floor under the front seat. <br>
                Those brave enough to attempt escape were severely injured. <br>
                Most died on impact with the road or were struck by vehicles speeding close behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The emergency services were of little use. All were, ofcourse, trapped inside their own autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end most starved to death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Census analysis shows a gaping hole where the planet’s richest 1% used to be. <br>
                The only people who could afford such luxuries as personal autonomous vehicles. <br>
                Deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Financial institutions, tech companies and government facilities now stand mostly empty. 
                The Body Retrieval Program is therefore small and underfunded.
            </p>
            <p>
                1% of the human race. <br>
                Their corpses now roam the highways in an endless loop with no final destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The knowledge of how to override the system is gone with them.
